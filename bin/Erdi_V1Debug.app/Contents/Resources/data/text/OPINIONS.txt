Brexit is a commonly used term for the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union.
The British government led by David Cameron held a referendum on the issue in 2016
a majority voted to leave the European Union. On 29 March 2017, 
Theresa Mays administration invoked Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union in a letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. 
The UK is set to leave by April 2019.
