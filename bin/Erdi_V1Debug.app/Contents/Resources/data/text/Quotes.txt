Soon nostalgia will be another name for Europe
We're just another remote places that doesn't impact other places at all
In Europe one gets used to doing nothing. You sit on your ass and whine all day.
When everyone gets together and cheers for one cause, it doesn't matter where you're from. That's the ultimate European feeling.
Europe has no common language, culture or values
Hope wherever we go in Europe we will feel like Here I am at home.
All the people in Europe should be like one people. And Paris should be the capital of the world.
They're Germans. Don't mention the war.
That Europe is nothin on earth but a great big auction, that's all it is, that bunch of old wron-out places, it's just a big fire-sale, the whole rotten thing.
If we're not in Europe, we're nothing.
